# Django Ecommerce Project

Developed a Django CRUD application for an online car shop. The application allows users to view, create, read, and update car listings.
The application uses a database to store the car listings, and Django models to interact with the database. Django views handle user 
requests and render HTML templates. Django forms allow users to create and update car listings. Django authentication and authorization 
protect the web application from unauthorized access. The application also includes a search feature that allows users to search for cars based on their criteria.
